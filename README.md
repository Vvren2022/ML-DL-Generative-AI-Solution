# ML-DL-Generative-AI-Solution
This project aims to develop an intelligent recommendation system that suggests the most optimal machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), or generative AI (LLM-based) solution based on a given problem statement and dataset description.The system follows a structured end-to-end pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and deployment recommendations.
If the problem is best solved with ML, it recommends models like SVM, XGBoost, or Random Forest with optimized hyperparameters.

If DL is more suitable, it suggests architectures like CNN, LSTM, or Transformers, along with dropout rates, optimizers, and batch sizes.

For Generative AI tasks (e.g., NLP, semantic search), it recommends LLMs (BERT, GPT), vector databases (FAISS, ChromaDB), and LangChain-based solutions for advanced AI-driven applications.

The final output provides a structured decision tree model to visualize the best approach, ensuring accuracy and efficiency for various AI/ML problems.
